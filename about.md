Hey! I'm **Chirag**, a Lead Software Engineer at **Samsung Ads**, where I architect and maintain backend systems that move a *ton* of data around. Specifically, I work on a data ingestion pipeline that stitches together APIs, Airflow DAGs, and Snowflake – helping teams across Samsung Ads make data-driven decisions.

Outside of work, I'm into:

- 🪐 **Astrophysics** – space stuff fascinates me
- ⚔️ **Anime** – recently got hooked
- 🏀 **Basketball** – on and off the court
- 💻 **Vim** – yes, I use it. yes, on purpose.

### Code & Contributions

Python (with type hints!) is my language of choice lately – simple, readable, and powerful. Java's in the toolbox too when needed.

I’m passionate about open source. One of my favorite moments recently? [Making a contribution to Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40705) – a small logging fix, but a big step into the OSS world for me.

People who contribute heavily to open source inspire me, and I'm excited to keep learning and giving back.
